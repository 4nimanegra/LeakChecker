# LeakChecker
An app to check the Leaks of your own accounts from android cell phones.

This app is an easy to use app to verify the passwords leaks of your accounts. Email or other Internet services. As connect to tor services is not easy enought for common users this tool provides an easy way to search in a Leak search service if the passwords for your internet accounts are public or not. If you found your password in this tool, change your password and verify all the credetinals beause other people could have login on your account. If the password does not appear or is an old one, do not mean that you have not been hacked. It means that the password is not in this leak database, so remain alert and change your passwords every month as ussually you should do.

## Important Note:

This app connects with a third party server in an onion service. Use as your own risk, I recomend to use the app by using WIFI.
This app has been made to test the leaks of your own passwords, not for hacking purposses, so only 4 characters of the leaked passwords will be shown on the interface (the first 2 and last 2 characters). This should be enought to know if your passwords has been leaked but will not be usable for hacking purposses.
Also, as an additional anti-hacking process has been introduced, a delay of 1 minute will be mandatory for each search.
